There are two envelopes with sides (a1, b1) and (a2, b2). The goal is to determine whether one envelope can be inserted into the other. 
The program handle the input of floating-point numbers. 
After each calculation, the program asks the user if he wants to continue. 
If the user answers “y” or “yes” (case insensitive), the program continues working from the beginning, otherwise it ends the execution.

Input: sideA1 sideB1 sideA2 sideB2
where: sideA1 and sideB1 are sides of the first envelope,
       sideA2 and sideB2 are sides of the second envelope.
